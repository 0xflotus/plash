#the idea:
# write a symlink to the node in $DATA/index, the filename is an uuid and shal not be deleted so we can track that this think exists without traversing folders.
# the given id is used as a filename for an symlink in the $DATA/alias folder. index in the alias folder can be deleted, renamed, etc.
