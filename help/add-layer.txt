USAGE: plash add-layer CONTAINER

Reads a shell script from stdin and returns a builded or cached container on top of the supplied container.
The new container is the only thing printed to stdout, building information and status messages are printed to stderr.
For most cases you would, use `plash build` for a higher level interface.
exit status:
same as `plash build`
